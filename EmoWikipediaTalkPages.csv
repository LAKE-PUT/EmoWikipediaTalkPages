The case you tried to solve was a difficult and contentious one and I fully support you walking away from it without reaching strong conclusion. You are a bigger man for doing so. I tried to figure out who was right but also got fully frusterated by the intracasies of what must have been going on for years.

1,*Look I really appreciate your words but right this second and believe me this isn't easy to write it isn't enough. I've been building all this up for ages because we have this good faith idea and we have this idea of being civil and it makes it so hard to vent. I really don't think the community values problem solvers anymore because every single decision made on Wikipedia is now open to review on so many counts it has become an institutionalised bureaucracy. Consideration is seriously undervalued on Wikipedia and I don't really see a way of improving it. I know in my own head I haven't got the make up to go rouge but I also know I can't be chipped at forever.

2,** The 'community' is shit. The part of the community that you care about - the people who want to empower other people to write an encyclopedia values problem solvers. We really do - I promise. Decisions on wikipedia are reviewed by people who believe it is an institutionalised bureaucracy and then the decisions are actually made the way they should be - by people who get it. I *know* it dosen't feel that way for you *right now* - and it didn't feel that way for me [external_link] but and not to put too agressive of a spin on it - we are/were wrong. Who is biting your back? Some putrid little troll? Some ultra-inclusionist Wikipedia Review kibitzer? An Encyclopedia Dramatica internet whore?

Although the 4WD article is very accurate the introduction is riddled with errors which I corrected. I think it is everyone's best interests to make Wiki pages as accurate as possible and the Four Wheel Drive article is not a gleaming example of this. i.e. All-wheel drive is just a marketing term invented to sell primarily on-road 4WD-type cars This is completely inaccurate AWD is no JUST a marketing term. AWD is very different from 4WD and I explained the differences in my edits. There are also blatant contradictions in this introduction as well.

23,Although AWD can be considered a form of 4WD it is not the same drive train type as Part-Time 4WD. So I would have to say calling it just a marketing term is a narrow minded and inaccurate statement. Even though they are similar you can't just lob them into the same group. If as you say AWD is just a marketing term then taking a turn in a Audi A6 Quattro would produce wheel hop just as taking a turn in a Ford F-250 4x4 with 4WD engaged which is not the case. So apparently there is a difference which would be the center differential in the Audi A6 allowing each wheel to receive a variable amount of power. Which is not true of 4WD vehicles because a transfer case unless a Full-Time 4WD transfer case will force all wheels to receive 25% of the engine's power.,127296808.516.516,User talk:Billzilla,False,3,interest,none,none,0.08151301990123458,0.10446245996296298,0.08947482546913582,0.08660590258024692,0.07939502151851852,0.0961164168765432,0.097826999691358,0.08065473674074074

30,bogdan if you registered yourself as 'orthodox' in the census then you are an orthdox (not atheist) for the sake of this page. We are talking about offcial figures here not your original research. How do you know that there are 'many' people in your alleged situation? How do we know that you did indeed declare yourself orthodox? Please leave original research and personal feelings aside when contributing here. As for the statistics you provide about church attendance they come from an obscure poll conducted by an NGO while the way people define themselves comes from the official census. Most foreigners visiting Romania notice the high church attendance rate (churches are packed and so on). Should the NGO's opinion deserve much space in the article? I believe not.,135048926.41980.41980,Talk:Romanians,False,1,aggresiveness,annoyance,aggresiveness,0.0874186696231884,0.11483512472463768,0.1157185983478261,0.11294257060869564,0.10852542936231888,0.11059285978260869,0.11611726331884058,0.08892194814492756
31,According to the 2002 census there are no less than 23105 atheist people in Romania so we are not talking about '1 family' here. This should evidently be included. Additionally rates of church attendance and 'actual belief' should also be included aside from census data since this gives a more complex insight into religion in Romania. The OSF survey that was previously cited is not from an 'obscure NGO' but rather the [wiki_link]. This poll is not challenging the census results in any way because it records an entirely different thing. The census records 'self-identified religion' while the OSF survey records 'church attendance'. You can still declare a certain religion in the census and even believe it but not go to church. They are two different things and thus not in contradiction with one another.,135048926.41980.41980,Talk:Romanians,False,2,annoyance,disapproval,submission,0.08818235930769232,0.11307984414102563,0.10030197276923078,0.09473630153846148,0.10300223316666667,0.09628223938461536,0.10927765702564105,0.07718867467948717

54,Firstly I'm not one of the 'gang' nor is AreJay or anyone here as Grace seems to put it. Secondly the 'neutral' view itself is not really well educated nor do they properly read the threads or history of the pages concerned. The neutral sources and some biased views are already given in the said articles. Yet Grace is asking that this user and his sockpuppets come to the talk page and show his sources. I wonder why a vandal would frequent a talk page? I don't see him coming and if anyone believes he is going to discuss this openly is naive. Secondly the problem isn't only to this article but ALL articles related to the India pakistan wars. Incase these neutrals don't have time to read or understand here's the lowdown: [wiki_link] keeps deleting the info on the bengali atrocities [wiki_link] just read it dammit. [wiki_link] more vandalism [wiki_link] copyvio images and copyvio text from biased sources [wiki_link] blatant copyvio images and jingoistic text [wiki_link] minor changes to suit his POV. Incase it has not been noticed he has a pattern of simply reverting to his previous version without engaging in discussion like we are doing here. So the fact is while we talk about this and try to resolve he jolly well seems to care less for Wikipedia or its neutral stance and simply reverts to his POV. In those articles too users like myself and other different users have reverted it to the non-chauvinistic versions time & again. is asking for this vandal to come to the talk page and discuss the 1971 war which the miscreant refuses to do. Yet nothing is being done about it or his blatant cut and copy of text from the net. If anyone still has any lingering doubts then search by selecting the sentences used to describe his photos on google and u will get an exact match down to the last punctuation error. To avoid such future disputes I suggest that people should have a user account incase they want to break the 3 revert rule. that way it would be easier to block the user.

102,Hey Orange - random question. As a medical doctor what's your opinion of chiropractic? I mean the least pseudoscientific sort - you know Mixer or Reform.

103,I actually don't believe that ANY medical procedure should receive a 'positive.' It should be balanced as to its success or failure rate side-effects etc. (No that doesn't mean I think that Alternative medicine is medicine.) However with respect to chiropracticundecided. From what I know Chiropractors receive significant education and training. They can read an x-ray of the spine much better than I can. They understand skeletal-muscular relationships fairly well. I consider them a higher level of masseuse one that understands kinesiology and other physiological relationships. They can't prescribe drugs (at least here in California) so they aren't quite physicians but they provide a service. A lot of physicians dislike them. A lot of physicians use their services. I think a neutrally positive article makes a lot of sense.,182195722.17081.17081,User talk:Orangemarlin,False,2,none,none,serenity,0.08495959816867467,0.11415356155421685,0.08874065895180722,0.09581232078313254,0.0972090106385542,0.10117677790361444,0.12622767110843372,0.08690112387951811

108,Hi there I wonder if I could grab your expertise. I've been working on [wiki_link] which you might know started its seventh series yesterday. One of the main characters Jonny has been written out but his section in [wiki_link] refers to events going way back to the beginning. Another user wants to move his section into a new 'Former characters' section and I am resisting on the basis that there are few characters in the series he is central to it and it makes no sense to me to have a separate section considering that this will probably be the last series anyway. I see [wiki_link] characters get moved into a complete new article but 'Two Pints' is a lot smaller in scope.

147,Guys I don't know who originally wrote the following passages (Revizionist?); just wanted to say that these are quite blatantly POV. You can't be serious that this is your best attempt at neutral writing? *the real [wiki_link] of the ethnic Macedonian conscience and identity occurred between the two world wars and triumphed during [wiki_link] *the [wiki_link] greater-[wiki_link] regime in [wiki_link] was destroying every form of manifestation of [wiki_link] consciousness ... and so on this goes for the whole section of which these sentences were part. I know this article used to have some heavily tendentious pro-Bulgarian material from the time Jingiby edited it. Now somebody seems to have gone and replaced it with some equally tendentious pro-Macedonian material. That's disappointing. I hope you guys can do better than this.

149,Hello Future. How are you doing? As you know the articles about ethnic Macedonians were a real mess. I made a revision of the article [wiki_link] and [wiki_link] which were approved by the majority as neutral and informative. I only want to finish with the revision of this article (which we all agree was very chaotic. But this can not be done over night. i go to work and in my free time (when I have some) I go to the library and read material take notes afterwards I translate them. It is a process. First I must finish inputing data (which as you see is informative - for example when which unit was formed when it was destroyed and so on). The user is reverting all my revisions (although I added 65% new text to the article). I must finish adding afterwards I will improve the English and afterwards we will adjust or exclude the things that according to the majority is not neutral. You know that I always make quality contributions. Don't worry let me finish it and afterwards we will all together make a great neutral article and maybe recommend it for an wiki award.

165,Well I noticed that it does not include the chart postions for the 70's line-ups fro 74-77 on Disco so I added them( look a discography). It shows they had 3 disco #1's and rest top 5 which is never talk about anywahere. The thing is this artcale saids basically the 70's line-up was struggling. Yes in terms of R&B and Pop in 1973 and onward but in Disco they had great success and should be noted on this artcle that they were succelful in Disco and had 3 #1 Disco hits. Also that the 2 line-ups found new success in Disco and had and that that they regained some of their fame in the form of the Disco hits. I am also edditing the top samples things and including the songs in the 70's that wer top 10 Disco and will provide a sample of them soon Thank you Saimaroimaru_2008.,211538523.5868.5868,Talk:The Supremes,False,1,serenity,disapproval,optimism,0.07608723741176472,0.10864549151764705,0.06810695940000001,0.08230389397647062,0.10706397667058822,0.10191823520000004,0.10282576350588238,0.11775432462352946
166,Well I perceive to think that the reason why it was taken out because there's too much chart info. You can mention the songs hitting the top ten/number-one spot on the now-vacant Billboard disco singles chart. If you wanna put all the chart information from all Supremes songs from various charts it'll be better to post it on their [wiki_link] page than on the main article just saying you know? LOL well it's there anyway I had to correct a few things since you probably was the one who put '1975' at the end of every track lol.

167,I undertsand the Disco charts are gone but its apart of their legacy wether we like it or not. Its a crime to not tell poeple the whole truth when its there to put up part of remembering them and honoring these great singers is to put up all of their history not just one era of their music. I understand its a lot of info to add but The Supremes had a lot of top 10 hits and the chances of a consertive supremes fans going to the discography is 3 of 7 and they mainly just look at the 60's part of it. ::Let me see. Oops guess I rushed when I was typing it. Thanks for putting the right year lol.

You posted it as your own work. The word you are looking for is 'plagiarism.' One could accept that as accident save you kept removing the citation after being alerted to it and behaved like a petulant babe caught with his hand in the cookie-jar in these comments. ...I didn't write it. Are we clear? Oh I understand you now admit you committed plagiarism. You compounded that by removing all reference to the author when you pasted it then when alerted to it you threw a tantrum as you are now. All you had to do was leave the citation. Instead you removed the citation not once but twice to leave the impression that 'you' wrote the material. It is really not terribly complicated.

207,Hello Skyring(Pete). I notice you have reverted edits on the Howard article recently. I thought we had all moved away from that kind of mode of editing. Reverts subvert the wishes of the editing community as a whole. It's better to allow the editing community to decide whether content stays or goes. Content disputes need to go through the dispute resolution process. In regard to the particular sentence about public figures who considered Howard's Iraq policy as contravening international laws against war crimes I've got no idea if the issue gets put to the community to decide whether it would live or die. It could go either way. But then we just have to accept the community decision. The concept is that by letting the community decide the audience of Wikipedia readers gets the type of encyclopaedia that they want (or deserve). My opinion is that reverting will only lead to trouble. If edit wars break out then it will only lead to penalties or sanctions against those who partake.,228468167.5005.5005,User talk:Skyring,True,1,interest,disapproval,none,0.08082593306796118,0.10735092108737868,0.0955358691262136,0.11319902726213589,0.10916337628155337,0.1234887141359223,0.1290902097281553,0.095714881592233

We have moved much material to the Howard Government article because that is where it properly goes but there is still much editorial work to bring both articles up to a proper standard with balanced and informed content supported by references.Not sure what the relevance is of the timing of Lester's warning to you - it was before your 3rd reversion.

In the DVDs where he's talking at least he does seem quite young (though that could be older footage) and supposedly his parents brought him to drop off his demo tape so I'm inclined to believe he is younger.

I'd recommend only using high-profile cases ones with a [wiki_link] level of attention given to them by the press. The [wiki_link] incident did (and does) deserve its own article since what he did was an unusual crime on a rather large scale very disgusting discussed in the news extensively and so on. Flashing is pretty commonplace and usually wouldn't advance beyond local news. I'd say just include the crimes in which the offenders already have articles in Wikipedia or who could have articles in Wikipedia without those articles getting contested by being [wiki_link].

However in writing about this phenomenon one must keep in mind that this terminology affects different groups unequally. The mainstream of society in this case White Anglo America consciously or unconsciously carries the history of its exploitive behavior towards racial and cultural minorities and an entirely 'race-neutral' perspective is anything but equal. 'Asian fetish' is an inherently racialized term for it is the expression of a racial minority. One cannot limit this expression as it is essentially a right of the minority group to react against the perceptual imbalances society has foisted upon it.

222,Hi Once an article has been nominated for deletion you cannot remove the AfD notice from the page. The process will continue with or without the tag but without it many other editors (those who don't frequent the AfD discussions) would be unaware that the article has been nominated and thus they won't be aware that the debate is occurring. In this case I don't think that there is anything to worry about as I'm aware that the subject is notable and I'll assist with some references to help get it through AfD. I'd be very surprised if consensus was to delete.

228,Hi Peter. If you're still around and willing to offer some quick advice I could do with some. I agree that the article is important so I've been thinking of helping to develop it. However I doubt I have anything like your knowledge of Spinoza. I'm much better with Hume. Towards that end do you think it would be worth mentioning Hume's approach on the probability of miracles? It clearly differs from Spinoza as it allows miracles to exist (as you mention in the lead) but I though it might provide a good contrast. The second is whether or not you're aware of where Hunter's 'Spinoza on miracles' paper sits in the literature. I've been enjoying it and his distinction between strong and weak miracles seems like it might be worth working into the article as does the conclusion he draws in relation to Spinoza's stance on the existence of miracles. Mind you it will take some time before I can catch up on teh literature to do any real work on this - I'm much better on phil. of mind and epistemology.,235345753.3081.3081,User talk:Peter Damian (old),False,1,interest,interest,interest,0.07379125789423079,0.11579266661538457,0.08525487155769232,0.09680738365384613,0.09873053322115387,0.10050227218269231,0.14109602316346154,0.07648653025000002
229,Thanks - as you see I've had enough for at least two months. Yes Hume's account of miracles - there is an article [wiki_link] already on the project - would be relevant. Also and I didn't have time to work on this is that Spinoza may (unlike Augustine) have been using the same argument to suggest that there aren't miracles.

231,Thanks. That's effectively what Hunter is arguing against: that Spinoza has been interpreted as arguing against the existence of miracles but Hunter believes that this is an incorrect interpretation. The strong/weak distinction (unknown vs unknowable) seems to be an interesting approach to allowing miracles in a sense to exist.

232,Yes. There is something else I would have added if I could find references. In arguing with pseudoscience proponents they very often use a similar argument. E.g. we should not deride telepathy fortune-telling and so on because the seem incredible for aviation would have seemed incredible 150 years ago.

234,I have just reverted who expanded upon this sentence that has remained in the article for some time. This has followed a lot of back & forth edits and one user (whom I cannot recall) making a logical statement: the sentence as it stood was correct in that all Jewish denominations agreed that a Jew was the child of a Jewish mother or a convert to Judaism - but that for Reform Jews (as an example) this also included MORE namely a Jew could be the child of a Jewish father. Therefore the sentence stood. However to expand it the way this user has done is to make a claim that mainstream (as opposed to 'traditional') also has strict rules etc. and these rules appear to be 'traditional' ones. Sorry - that is simply not the case. Mainstream denotes most of/the majority of/virtually all/etc. of Judaism and not just the traditional. If you want to speak about the additional 'rules' stick that in the traditional section the same way the progressive ideals of Reform are placed appropriately.

235,A more neutral way of putting it would be something like: 'All denominations agree that a person may be a Jew either by birth or through conversion. However they differ on what these requirements consist of. The traditional view is that only the child of a Jewish mother is Jewish by birth; some denominations now also allow the child of a Jewish father and non-Jewish mother in certain circumstances.

239,This article is nothing but a bunch of 's opinionated trash. Numerous times people have tried to label the article with the NPOV template and the user continues to remove it. I have asked the user to explain how the term is not pejorative and have gotten no answers but yet the user continues to remove my edits. Who made you the foremost thinker on this subject? The greatest thing about wikipedia is that it is a community in which people can learn to compromise and uncover the truth about topics you only seem to be interested in pushing your subjective POV and blowing this topic way out of proportion. 'Asian fetish' is a pejorative term to whites blacks hispanics and asians. You make it sound like it is impossible for there to be any type of healthy interracial relationship without one culture exploiting the other. And your research methods are deplorable: This article has no objective sources or references that have been peer-reviewed or published anywhere notable. You added a section about how asian women who seemingly only date white men can be called a 'cracker chasing bitch' with a reference to urbandictionary.com by all means far from a reputable source. I have never even heard that before. Furthermore the social consequences section illustrates perfectly the problem of creating a hypothesis and then going out and looking for it in society. Just because there are some rare unfortunate cases of sickos who do not know how to act right in this world doesn't mean you can generalize that about an entire population. What about all the other functional white/asian relationships out the (the article itself points out that they are prevalent) that get no media coverage or national attention because they are just boring regular couples with no sick exploitation.

246,I was a bit disgruntled you recently deleted my article on SocialVibe especially just after it had been patrolled. I am a user of the site who was interested in its message and felt compelled to look further into it (seriously my sources are the first couple things that popped up after a google search). I am a bit confused why a well written and documented article (my first) about an up and coming social networking website with well over 25000 subscribers and almost 150000 unique visitors each month (http://www.crunchbase.com/company/socialvibe) is any less relevant than say Sandis Valters whose brilliantly written article reveals that he is a Latvian guard who plays for ASK Riga. Having seen such articles before I did not feel the need to 'justify' my article however I am new at editing/creating wikipedia articles did I do something incorrectly? Please respond as I would like to know what I did wrong...,240149353.16332.16332,User talk:Orangemike,False,1,anticipation,pensiveness,interest,0.08423847897727271,0.12102930809090906,0.0942255446590909,0.10076482707954545,0.11237429315909092,0.09874817882954547,0.10721319288636368,0.08822435821590911
247,Well I am not sure if the article meets [wiki_link] but I think that a claim of 150000 users a month is a decent claim of notability and there are a few mentions in RS in Google News so could you undelete this article and then send it to AfD where its notability can be better decided. -,240149353.16332.16332,User talk:Orangemike,False,2,disapproval,none,none,0.08483719537037036,0.0993997231851852,0.09734910692592591,0.09098091607407408,0.08868108474074075,0.09927913207407409,0.10589466925925928,0.07431891325925924
248,With regard to the article's lack of notability and a lack of citations look at [wiki_link]. It has only one citation not linking to itself in its entire article (whereas 6 similar sources are used on socialvibe) and it has never logged more than 10000 unique users/month in its short history (http://www.crunchbase.com/company/bluepulse). A google search for bluepulse yields 77000 results whereas a search for socialvibe gives 146000. Bluepulse has big numbers of page views and mobile downloads but it refuses to tell media outlets how many users acutally use their site. I like the ideas behind bluepulse's product but until it is more widely used it is not yet nearly as notable as socialvibe nor does their wiki article use nearly as many citations. And browsing very quickly through other social networking sites I am sure that this is not the only one.

269,Is it worth mentioning that the number of complaints (18k and rising) have not been from the shows target audience? When the show with the 'prank calls' was aired only about 5 complaints were received. It wasn't until the media started reporting on it that thousands of complaints came in. The number is still rising and I really wonder how many of them have actually heard the calls. I just think something should be mentioned about the amount of complaints by older people who don't listen to the show. It's not aimed at them so what right do they have to complain?

273,Potentially that is a mine field as they have every right to complain.

279,Many tks for the GA review of '[wiki_link]' and your kind words at the end. Since you raise the point of similar nominations I wonder if you'd do me the favour of quickly assessing '[wiki_link]' '[wiki_link]' and '[wiki_link]' - reckon they're B-class but always prefer a peer to check that when I've largely written the article. As far as another GAN goes I guess I'd be looking at what requires the least work since I'm having to severely ration my time on the music-related stuff at the moment. If you have suggestions among the Bowie albums let me know. They'd have to be pretty well up-to-scratch content-wise and only require the sort of fix-ups I did on 'Station' for me to nominate though. A related one I find the most likely candidate now is in fact '[wiki_link]' - comprehensive and well-cited if not to the same extent as 'Station' since as you've deduced I kind of see that one as FA material for depth and breadth even though it will need some further style and citation improvements to pass FAC.

282,On behalf of federal web managers I would like to get some clarification and guidance and maybe start a discussion regarding employees of the federal government editing Wikipedia articles. I primarily mean civil servants rather than political appointees and specifically as part of our responsibility to provide accurate information to the public. We recognize that Wikipedia is a frequent resource for many Internet users including us. Our log files show that federal websites receive many referrals from Wikipedia. And many of us support and respect the work that the Wikipedia community does to create quality articles. We understand and have studied policies and guidelines and more than one of us have edited a page or two. I am reaching out to the Wikipedia community to help us develop appropriate guidelines and policies for [external_link] and our participation. COI guidelines seem to discourage employees from editing on behalf of employers but we frequently see information that is unclear or sometimes wrong. While we know we can just edit we want to do so transparently and acceptably. There is concern that we will offend the Wikipedia community and encourage negative attention if we get this wrong. On the other hand there are great resources in the federal (and state and local) space that would be valuable to Wikipedia users and we know about them and can cite them too. So what are the best ways for federal employees to contribute to this project? For example some federal editors will only edit in their official capacity from a government computer with a government IP and from a Wikipedia account. Should that account indicate the name of the agency? Whether it is a communications or a program office? I don't think there would be any controversy on editing dates that are incorrect or improving a reference or correcting an error (like which agency has jurisdiction over an area). Are there things that we 'shouldn't' edit? For substantive changes should we be explicit about our roles on talk pages? If we don't get any feedback on proposed changes how long should we wait until we make the change ourselves? Other ideas/areas/pitfalls? The goal is to create guidelines and best practices for the federal web community. We will publish on [external_link]. I am happy to move this to another area if that makes more sense and if you want to post comments and discussion on my page please do. Thanks for your help.,251263251.32055.32055,Wikipedia talk:Conflict of interest,False,1,none,none,anticipation,0.09019515031415928,0.10692077880530966,0.09344812465486725,0.09509673267256638,0.1031813815176991,0.1015544873539823,0.11237828731415919,0.08483567689823004
283,Replied over at . Others are welcome to add their own suggestions in that thread. Answering your specific question I'd say that an employee who is editing an article that relates to what their employer does is strongly advised to give their affiliation when they comment on Talk. (Not their personal identity just their affiliation). They should also be sure to abide by the advice in [wiki_link]. Sometimes they may have specialized knowledge due to their work. If so they should not make changes to articles that are based entirely on personal knowledge; everything should be cited to a published source.,251263251.32055.32055,Wikipedia talk:Conflict of interest,False,2,none,none,serenity,0.08475420164705881,0.11883590292156862,0.10504478943137258,0.11331793280392156,0.12226909900000002,0.10297031031372544,0.11198404854901962,0.08396097033333333
284,Given that most govt employees have the arm of the law behind them I would say that employees editing from work or home on issues related to their job or employeers need a higher standard of disclosure and should do so only by declaring themselves govt employees either in signature or in edit summary. (I personally would like to go further and see their allowed edits 'only' be to put a tag on information citing the problem with it leaving any deletion to non-government employees 'including alleged defamation in Biographies.' Of course on the other hand their outing themselves in any case might intimidate others into deleting material that shouldn't be deleted! So any editing of material related to their jobs can be problematic. In any case I think [wiki_link] should specifically mention government employees and will discuss at that talk page.

You can see in the second link that the swear words were part of a conversation he started about Microsoft Sam with a comment on the first link. The warning he refers to in the first link is when he replaced my use of the word 'bulls**t' with 'censored by Mr. Clean' something I didn't even notice at first glance and not really a direct warning. I took it to be just a joke about Mr. Clean he should have just come out and asked me'Please don't use swear words on my talkpage.' Instead he just accused me of vandalism then came and vandalized my userpage.,31052958.3908.3908,User talk:Malo,False,3,disapproval,surprise,surprise,0.07276814773749998,0.11857481010000001,0.09250037279999998,0.10445024248750001,0.11886987674999994,0.10326753628749999,0.1023191056875,0.07474990828750001

370,The U hand gesture has nothing to do with the name 'The U'. It has to do with the split-U logo which is called 'The U'. The school is called 'The U'. The sports community refers to it as 'The U'. Even forgetting the single hit on the school's website for 'The U.S. State Dept' the use of 'The U' even in quotations of faculty/staff or on the website itself shows the pervasiveness of the name. 'The U' may be an abbreviation for 'The University' but that does not in any way mean that every school known as 'The University of...' is 'The U'. Only a few are referred to as such. 'The U' is an informal name just like any alias for any major university. Researchers from [wiki_link] do not introduce themselves as being from 'NC State' as far as I am aware. If you want to be really anal about the use of the words then when the article is unprotected because of your repeated edit warring over the lead paragraph 'commonly' can be replaced with 'informally'.

In the future it'll be easier on you if you go through the proper channels to get the sock blocked instead of continually reverting.

389,Once upon a time (around 1500) Erasmus while studying Ancient and New Testament Greek developed a theory on Ancient Greek pronunciation (also known as reconstructed or erasmian system). The other theory is called Reuchlinian or traditional and it supports that the Ancient Greek were speaken like the Modern Greek (in 1500 that would be Byzantine Greek) (my personal opinion is that probably both systems are or could be wrong). disagrees with the reconstructed system and did a pov-renaming of the article. disagreed with that and changed part of the new title (removed the '19th century' part of the title). Most editors involved in that article are somewhat 'tired' of Thrax and I tried (or thought I did) to help them co-operate on expanding the article. Thrax may have given some good arguments (and not only wrong examples as some other editors may think) but the rename of the article certainly was a wrong thing to do. While this article doesn't cover the whole [wiki_link] yet the titles [wiki_link] or [wiki_link] certainly do not describe the article as good as the previous title. has also helped with that article and if I'm not mistaken he is a (new) admin so perhaps you could talk with Kwami too about it.

390,Hello BW. Sometimes wikipedia can be stressful which is one of the reasons I now take frequent breaks for a week or so. I can feel one coming up soon. I hope you don't mind me saying but I get the feeling you are becoming a little stressed out at the moment. Take it from me a break away from here does wonders for you.

391,There have been alot of issues that have all come up in recent weeks which are very time consuming and have distracted me from other things. Im trying to cut down ive not got involved on the Ireland collab page for the past few days as that seems to be going round and round in circles but as soon as one issue fades away another one seems to flare up. Like the British isles examples on the taskforce page i thought that was dying down now we have dozens of British Islands / isles links which need clearing up so its accurate which will take a lot of time. I will try to make less opinionated comments on the talk page regarding the British Isles article but the radical change to the intro which led to an edit war hardly got the debate off to a good start and I did find the wording it was changed too totally unacceptable. : But i couldnt possibly take a full break for a period of a week or two from wikipedia sometimes that can be more stressful if you come back to find dozens of things have happened and you then have to spend days catching up and you are in a weaker position if the change has been made already. Sometimes i pop on just to check if anything major has happened and if it hasnt then i go on with other things but sometimes i cant just ignore something and must make a comment then ofcourse when the person replies to my comment i must reply and so on till dozens of responses have been made over what some would see as a small issue.,317082366.17344.17344,User talk:BritishWatcher,True,2,acceptance,disapproval,remorse,0.09007571356834529,0.12224506131654672,0.09180366604316546,0.10305189469064743,0.10874503530935253,0.11420492358273379,0.12274646539568346,0.09604810355395686

If it goes to DRV now its quite possible that the editors who are in favor of the redirect will skew the view of consensus (not because of any bad motive mind you but just from being more invested at this point contributing and defending their views).

You should bring it up [wiki_link] if you want some thing done. Good day. It's obviously not. If it's consensus then why would it not be on the [wiki_link] page. I'm not going to listen to what you think notability is but if the guidelines change I will follow them. I have asked three separate editors and they can't find anything that says 'minor leaguers are not notable enough for their own article' like you said. I'm going to believe [wiki_link] over you unless you prove there is a 'consensus.' ::::: and at the same time (he deleted the discussion so here is the [external_link]) and  who couldn't produce the 'consensus' you spoke of. You say 'it was agreed to at [wiki_link] a while ago' but [wiki_link] is WP:Baseball and it says Minor league players managers coaches executives and umpires are not assumed to be inherently notable. To establish that one of these is notable the article must cite published secondary source material which is reliable intellectually independent and independent of the subject. You're making up a consensus and I'm not buying it. You could have done that without wasting my time! And when you say 'A while ago the user:Gjr rodriguez created a bunch of minor league players' gives me no point of reference. The [wiki_link] page was updated in April of this year. If there was 'consensus' it would have been changed.

The discussion has now stretched way beyond 10000 words (with me providing more than my share) and that has made its way past a [wiki_link]. I guess it all depends whether the following issue is one time permitting with which you would like to become involved. I've raised issue regarding the title of the article. Creation myth' after seeing the talk page notice which claimed: The article title adheres to the [wiki_link] policy... . I did not think that this was the case and began the related [wiki_link]. It's got quite a charged on both sides at times and amongst other things I've taken the view that some of the editors may want to bring the issue to a swift conclusion. A full review of all the issues mentioned would be appreciated but not knowing when you may see this message or which other editors may have taken an interest in this topic it may be worthwhile to make an initial check of the current state of the discussion so as to check the current state of the debate. I do not personally hold any religious faith and yet considered the neutrality issues that I perceived to have been raised by the article title to be worth tackling I realise that this is an issue that I have personally raised and finally I don't have any expectation of outside involvement and just mention this in case this issue may also be of interest for you. regards,326601085.7426.7426,User talk:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters,False,1,none,interest,interest,0.09014471157763973,0.11939112137267086,0.11123290618633543,0.11467380818633541,0.12340973903105586,0.11909750214906827,0.12772488755900616,0.0949464420124224
421,I am not quite sure what you are requesting exactly nor what particular expertise you think I have. However glancing at the discussion on [wiki_link] it appears to me that the title is neutral and correct and a move to 'Account of creation' would introduce [wiki_link] phrasing in place of the commonly used and accepted anthropological and literary-theory term. It appears you might be unfamiliar with the scientific use of the term 'myth' and misread it as meaning something like 'untrue story' instead. However even the introduction to the article seems to give a rather good definition of this accepted scientific usage so that would be a good start.,326601085.7426.7426,User talk:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters,False,2,none,none,boredom,0.0766671496885246,0.13543651686885247,0.09708456152459016,0.11908523021311475,0.10987622372131146,0.10734029036065575,0.1298069374590164,0.07716210649180325

424,A certain amount of context and common sense is required to interpret The Rules of Wikipedia. We ought to avoid getting too detailed in the explanations because no matter how much we specify those who lack social skills can try to lawyer The Rules to their advantage.

426,Hi I noticed you have been mass deleting links related to the 'AWMDB link' template. In the discussion about its deletion it was stated 'they should be substituted prior to the template being deleted' not that they should be deleted altogether unless you have another reason?,341366438.17798.17798,User talk:Dismas,False,1,aggresiveness,annoyance,interest,0.09055458658333333,0.12478024595833336,0.09295681708333337,0.1248137285833333,0.12408179870833332,0.08984742141666664,0.10564741204166665,0.08065132291666666
427,Yes I have another reason which I stated in my edit summaries. Since the site isn't notable they're just another web link and therefore pointless. WP is not a random collection of links per [wiki_link].,341366438.17798.17798,User talk:Dismas,False,2,serenity,annoyance,none,0.06338251960869563,0.10086935039130433,0.066390238,0.08570598269565217,0.09325636556521738,0.08123954304347829,0.09647111304347825,0.06485880073913043
428,You don't think it's notable in the fact it provides information that isn't otherwise available elsewhere? The discussion about the template clearly stated 'The external link guidelines do not require a site to be notable in order for us to link there'. I would also say those links are relevant since they provide a unique resource beyond what the articles contain. The articles do not contain detailed information about those performers web-based scenes as the website 'Adult Web Movie Database' does therefore it may be worth including within the external links since it provides information not within the articles and information that is probably better served as an external link rather than a part of the articles. With your deletions this information is no longer covered at all unless you can find another website that tracks web performances/scenes/movies with more information I would say that a minor link via the external links section would be of benefit.,341366438.17798.17798,User talk:Dismas,False,3,disapproval,anger,annoyance,0.09354492534736841,0.10667604411578943,0.10078187823157894,0.09309332529473685,0.10217413236842111,0.10592868336842103,0.1051015905684211,0.0821731049368421

430,Please excuse my ignorance but what is this mention of 'Ahwazi' in the article? I have never heard Arabs here call themselves Ahwazi just Arab.

431,The [wiki_link] refers to a UNCHR report on the forced confiscation of land owned by Laks a Persian tribe but there is little material available to expand on this.

432,Also I have read some articles here on Wikipedia not all but there is much racism against both Arab and Persian and it would be nice if everyone could stop promoting racism against one group while fighting racism of the other. What government does against Arabs does not mean Iranians are racist against Arabs when same government also forces Persians and others into poverty.

433,Hajjagha: None of the content I have written has been anti-Persian. In fact I have been at pains to show that the Arab unrest is not a communal Arab-Persian conflict but related to dissatisfaction with government policy.

435,The parts I deleted were an unsubstantiated rant about ethnicity in Iran in the human rights section. It was little more than propaganda with no attempt to point to secondary material and anyway the English was appalling. I decided to make references to reports by HRW Amnesty and UNCHR (I don't think these are pan-Arab or anti-Persian organisations) but also added a 'criticism' section countering human rights allegations. I believe I summarised many of the points made before. But if you would like to expand on this and perhaps give reference to other secondary material substantiating the arguments then go ahead. You Zereshk have made a point about the importance of secondary material to counter 's analysis of Khuzestan's history. I believe I have met the standards of proof you are demanding.

436,If it's bad English then fix it. That's no reason for deletion. Secondly youre eclipsing the page with ethno-political material which was already mentioned in 2 sections in the article and had its own linked page. Also your edits were not balanced. Write any anti-Iranian rant you like. But also be fair and write the view of your opposition. I dont see you doing that. You deleted the opposition on dubious reasons.

438,Hi Nableezy. I was actually not checking your contributions this time but you came up twice on my watchlist. I didn't want to chime in at the noticeboards since it boarders on wikistalking and I don't want to come across as trying to influence a discussion that I'm not part of. So my two cents: [wiki_link] is important as you pointed out. However you may be ignoring [wiki_link]. Although a transcript would be appreciated for [wiki_link] I am under the impression that it is not a necessity. If Arab Cowboy (that part was stalkerish) or Cleo need to give more details so the reader can track it down (email phone call movie rental extra extra googling or whatever) it should be considered. It is also a BLP which requires even more caution. If the guy can be verified as not saying it is so then it really needs to be spelled out in the article ('x has been reported.

439,I am not ignoring that. There has to be a physical record that about this interview something being shown on TV once is not enough especially given the number of sources that contradict this supposed interview. And since you brought it up the policy says 'Verifiability in this context means that anyone should be able to check the sources to verify that material in a Wikipedia article has already been published by a reliable source'.

So let's focus on the actual issues of Gill's contested edit and suggestions and how to resolve then. So let me restate what the issue are and what they are not. The following points were problematic to some of the other editors: *p1) large editorial changes without consent in highly contested article (something that ideally should be avoided *p2) deletion of formal Bayes solution in a 3 step experiment *p3) lack of citations and possible [wiki_link] *p4) style/language which might not be optimal for an encyclopedic article (imho at times it reads a bit like polemic or essay which is ok for journal articles but usually not appropriate for WP see the use of adjectives for instance) The following things however were not really problematic since so far there wasn't any serious disagreement: *n1) (mathematical) correctness of the odds approach (nobody suggested it is not correct) *n2) odds approach in the article (nobody really claims that the odds approach cannot be in the article the issue was with using it as a replacement for formal bayes solution but that can be discussed in p2) *n3) game theoretic aspects in the article (nobody really claims it cannot be a part of the article) So I suggest to leave n1n2n3 alone and focus on p1 p2 p3 p4 which for the most part can easily be fixed.,370760170.48343.48343,Talk:Monty Hall problem,False,1,distraction,annoyance,serenity,0.0868554586808511,0.10613931647517728,0.08913366067375886,0.09837844235460996,0.10318263505673758,0.10509585370212769,0.12433534924113479,0.08120552514893617

480,Hi I noticed is edit warring on the [wiki_link] article. He has been attempting to remove content without discussing his reasons for 2 weeks now. These changes should be reverted as they have been; however after reverting changes the user should be notified via their talk page that their edit has not been accepted after the second attempt to remove content the user should have been warned that it is not acceptable; making comments such as 'Would this dick calling itself Ganymede please piss off.' and simply undo the changes is not constructive. Please attempt to resolve the problem with the user asap in future if after that the use continues to [wiki_link] they should reported to an administrator.

After the creation of those two subsections (by you) there was nothing much left in the 'overview' subsection which was not repeated in other parts. So if this 'overview' which simply doubles with the 'intro' is empty it should be deleted as a subsection.

504,Is there any particular reason why you changed my edit on the [wiki_link] page? The franchise originated in the WHL. The club that played in the WHL is the same franchise that entered the NHL. This is no different then the [wiki_link]. When Barry Van Gerbig was awarded an expansion team for the San Francisco market in 1965 (for the 1967/68 season) he purchased the WHL club that year. He wanted to use that club as his expansion team. He decided it would be better to put the team in Oakland because the arena was brand new versus the venerable Cow Palace in San Francisco. This is why he moved the team from San Francisco to Oakland in 1966/67 (and renamed them the California Seals). He wanted to prepare the club for their transfer into the NHL. When he brought the Seals into the NHL the following year as an expansion team he even kept a chunk of the roster intact. This included Charlie Burns George Swarbrick Gerry Odrowski Tom Thurlby and Ron Harris. Not only is this mentioned in the official NHL publication from 1991 called 'The Official National Hockey League 75th anniversary commemorative book' but its also noted in Brad Kurtzberg's great book 'Shorthanded: The Untold Story of the Seals: Hockey's Most Colorful Team'. Heck in the 1967/68 NHL pre-season the Seals wore their WHL uniforms. I've seen pictures of them playing against the LA Kings with the WHL uniforms. They unveiled a new design prior to the start of the NHL regular season. So the fact is the franchise originated in 1961 in the WHL. To remove that info is to remove established fact.,426724280.6734.6734,User talk:Ravenswing,False,1,none,annoyance,disapproval,0.06660610869411764,0.09360561554117644,0.06046448744117648,0.07469003795294116,0.09835884984705887,0.09868213085294124,0.09303556697647052,0.07926308512941181

525,SC that's just plain wrong. The technology that led to the expansion of the Indo-European languages is believed to have been horse-drawn chariots used in warfare. The originators were peoples of the steppe and the technology and associated language seems to have spread from the steppes down into the Afghan plateau (per Witzel) and thence into India and Persia. The Medes and Persians seem to have been peoples of the central Iranian plateau speaking Proto-Iranian languages and from 'there' spreading down the Karun valley into the Mesopotamian plains. They didn't 'settle' in Elam they conquered it! You've distorted history to make a nationalist point.

546,Hi. The common thought advocating the use of spoilers is for 'courtesty for the reader'. As a user that has been present on the project for a extended amount of time has been any complaints issued from readers to the foundation concerning this or any archived requests on the mailing list. I'm concerned because I'm not able to verify if the original creation and implementation was a reply to comments or a dire need. I'm convinced it was more of a assumption lacking any basis of fact of previous edvidence.

549,I replaced some of these which had been removed from this article and added a couple more. These prevented things like ' John XXII' and '2 November' breaking at their spaces at the end of lines. I understand these uses are recommended on [wiki_link]. Another editor disagreed and kept reverting my edits. I can understand people not thinking this is absolutely necessary and may not wish to spend time on it when editing but why remove what is only a (small) improvement? With the use of smaller screens now on tablets and smartphones there is far more likelihood of lines breaking at confusing places so more NBSPs in these appropriate places are becoming even more useful.

It also does not mean that you delete an entire citation just because you don't think the website on which the citation is found is reliable you can actually cite stuff here that isn't on the web at all!

570,The Bradley named after WWII General Omar Bradley is a replacement for the M113 family of APCs and consists of two types of vehicles the M2 Infantry Fighting Vehicle and the M3 Cavalry Fighting Vehicle. 'The M3 CFV was originally going to be named after General Jacob L. Devers but it was decided the Bradley name would apply to both since both vehicles are based on the same chassis (they differ in only some details)'. The M2 carries a crew of three and a six-man infantry squad. The M3 on the other hand carries only a two-man scout team and additional radios TOW and Dragon or Javelin missiles. Where did you find the source for this statement? According to 'Camp Colt:...' the Bradley was always to be a composite vehicle designed specifically to satisfy the needs of both Infantry and Cavalry. That being true and given the Army's naming conventions of using a common name for all versions of a program that share all or most components it is highly unlikely that they would assign a seperate name for what is - for want of a better description - essentially an identical vehicle which is internally re-arranged to fulfill similar but distinct missions.,70475487.1262.1239,Talk:Bradley Fighting Vehicle,False,1,serenity,none,none,0.08526982067543859,0.08965721871929826,0.10095412519298246,0.08375255416666669,0.08794986670175438,0.09349372163157896,0.09737118020175442,0.0896216880877193
571,The M3 Bradley CFV is a designation confirmed by Army sources. While it seems that they do not warrant different designations it is likely that the history behind who it was to be named after had some part in the desire for a seperate designation. By your logic there should have been no way that the XM107 rifle could have come into being since it should have been from all accounts a variant of the M82 rifle already type classified. The Army is well known for its refusal to change things once on paper and it was likely that after the M3 Devers CFV designation was dropped it was simply easier to change the name rather than the entire designation.,70475487.1262.1239,Talk:Bradley Fighting Vehicle,False,2,serenity,none,disapproval,0.10517767685964911,0.11136612243859649,0.10540047147368425,0.1041508722280702,0.091792166,0.09566430291228072,0.08652341824561405,0.08939865403508775

573,Hi thanks for removing the fair use image from my user page. However since the image was given as part of an award given to me by another user you also inadvertently removed the text as well. I suspect that you also did that to other people who also received the award. I would like to suggest that instead of removing the entire section you should replace the image with something like 'fair use image removed' or something so that the text of the award is still preserved. I didn't like going to my user page and finding that Evilphoenix's words of praise were missing from it.

So its okay to say the 'rap commnuity' believes Game's change of heart footage destroyed his credibility? Since when do Encyclopedia's state biased garbage that by your own words aren't proven.

Are you saying that it is sad when one's life story is not as big as the impact that their fictionalized role potrayals have become (e.g. larger-than-life)? If so I agree. Such as in the case of that people can't expect Shatner to be much else other than Kirk. Or were you thinking it is sad that those contributing to this article are focusing more on the cultural affect of Wayne versus his personal life story? If the latter I would disagree Wayne made conscious choices to portray himself as a cultural icon so it is part of his personal life story especially when his iconic image is inconsistent with his private life.

606,IMO the image isn't worth the dispute. I only have concern about it because I figure it's better to get the right image now then to use an improper image and have it removed later after the subject is deceased or out of the public eye. I don't know why they're so vehement about being right or wrong it's just a photo.

Everyone had a chance to consider the processes. And a consensus to keep the category deleted emerged. I don't see any merit in restoring the category and repeating all the arguments again at [wiki_link]. It seemed clear that there was an even stronger consensus for seeing the thing deleted through process. To me it seemed expedient to cut to the chase. I think there was a consensus there to keep the category deleted. I used my judgement and declared it.
