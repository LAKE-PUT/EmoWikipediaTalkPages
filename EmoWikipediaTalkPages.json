Which is not true of 4WD vehicles because a transfer case unless a Full-Time 4WD transfer case will force all wheels to receive 25% of the engine's power.","conv_id":"127296808.516.516","conv_title":"User talk:Billzilla","conv_awry":false,"no.":3,"plutchik_emotion1":"interest","plutchik_emotion2":"none","plutchik_emotion3":"none","emowordnet_afraid_score":0.0815130199,"emowordnet_amused_score":0.10446246,"emowordnet_angry_score":0.0894748255,"emowordnet_annoyed_score":0.0866059026,"emowordnet_dontcare_score":0.0793950215,"emowordnet_happy_score":0.0961164169,"emowordnet_inspired_score":0.0978269997,"emowordnet_sad_score":0.0806547367},{"index":24,"text":"this wikipedia is not your fan page. :: and are you japanese?","conv_id":"128593760.5542.5542","conv_title":"Talk:Lexus","conv_awry":true,"no.":1,"plutchik_emotion1":"aggresiveness","plutchik_emotion2":"contempt","plutchik_emotion3":"contempt","emowordnet_afraid_score":0.0761763095,"emowordnet_amused_score":0.1196955518,"emowordnet_angry_score":0.0629535625,"emowordnet_annoyed_score":0.0838415108,"emowordnet_dontcare_score":0.1436358078,"emowordnet_happy_score":0.1072442165,"emowordnet_inspired_score":0.080179963,"emowordnet_sad_score":0.0762730795},{"index":25,"text":"The goal of this article is not to promote Japanese culture, references of Japan are made when they are directly relevant to the history of Lexus.

Secondly the 'neutral' view itself is not really well educated nor do they properly read the threads or history of the pages concerned. The neutral sources and some biased views are already given in the said articles. Yet Grace is asking that this user and his sockpuppets come to the talk page and show his sources. I wonder why a vandal would frequent a talk page? I don't see him coming and if anyone believes he is going to discuss this openly is naive. Secondly the problem isn't only to this article but ALL articles related to the India pakistan wars. Incase these neutrals don't have time to read or understand here's the lowdown: [wiki_link] keeps deleting the info on the bengali atrocities [wiki_link] just read it dammit. [wiki_link] more vandalism [wiki_link] copyvio images and copyvio text from biased sources [wiki_link] blatant copyvio images and jingoistic text [wiki_link] minor changes to suit his POV. Incase it has not been noticed he has a pattern of simply reverting to his previous version without engaging in discussion like we are doing here. So the fact is while we talk about this and try to resolve he jolly well seems to care less for Wikipedia or its neutral stance and simply reverts to his POV. In those articles too users like myself and other different users have reverted it to the non-chauvinistic versions time & again. is asking for this vandal to come to the talk page and discuss the 1971 war which the miscreant refuses to do. Yet nothing is being done about it or his blatant cut and copy of text from the net. If anyone still has any lingering doubts then search by selecting the sentences used to describe his photos on google and u will get an exact match down to the last punctuation error. To avoid such future disputes I suggest that people should have a user account incase they want to break the 3 revert rule. that way it would be easier to block the user.

I notice you have reverted edits on the Howard article recently. I thought we had all moved away from that kind of mode of editing. Reverts subvert the wishes of the editing community as a whole. It's better to allow the editing community to decide whether content stays or goes. Content disputes need to go through the dispute resolution process. In regard to the particular sentence about public figures who considered Howard's Iraq policy as contravening international laws against war crimes I've got no idea if the issue gets put to the community to decide whether it would live or die. It could go either way. But then we just have to accept the community decision. The concept is that by letting the community decide the audience of Wikipedia readers gets the type of encyclopaedia that they want (or deserve). My opinion is that reverting will only lead to trouble.

I primarily mean civil servants rather than political appointees and specifically as part of our responsibility to provide accurate information to the public. We recognize that Wikipedia is a frequent resource for many Internet users including us. Our log files show that federal websites receive many referrals from Wikipedia. And many of us support and respect the work that the Wikipedia community does to create quality articles. We understand and have studied policies and guidelines and more than one of us have edited a page or two. I am reaching out to the Wikipedia community to help us develop appropriate guidelines and policies for [external_link] and our participation. COI guidelines seem to discourage employees from editing on behalf of employers but we frequently see information that is unclear or sometimes wrong. While we know we can just edit we want to do so transparently and acceptably. There is concern that we will offend the Wikipedia community and encourage negative attention if we get this wrong. On the other hand there are great resources in the federal (and state and local) space that would be valuable to Wikipedia users and we know about them and can cite them too. So what are the best ways for federal employees to contribute to this project? For example some federal editors will only edit in their official capacity from a government computer with a government IP and from a Wikipedia account. Should that account indicate the name of the agency? Whether it is a communications or a program office? I don't think there would be any controversy on editing dates that are incorrect or improving a reference or correcting an error (like which agency has jurisdiction over an area). Are there things that we 'shouldn't' edit? For substantive changes should we be explicit about our roles on talk pages? If we don't get any feedback on proposed changes how long should we wait until we make the change ourselves? Other ideas\/areas\/pitfalls? The goal is to create guidelines and best practices for the federal web community. We will publish on [external_link]. I am happy to move this to another area if that makes more sense and if you want to post comments and discussion on my page please do.

The following points were problematic to some of the other editors: *p1) large editorial changes without consent in highly contested article (something that ideally should be avoided *p2) deletion of formal Bayes solution in a 3 step experiment *p3) lack of citations and possible [wiki_link] *p4) style\/language which might not be optimal for an encyclopedic article (imho at times it reads a bit like polemic or essay which is ok for journal articles but usually not appropriate for WP see the use of adjectives for instance) The following things however were not really problematic since so far there wasn't any serious disagreement: *n1) (mathematical) correctness of the odds approach (nobody suggested it is not correct) *n2) odds approach in the article (nobody really claims that the odds approach cannot be in the article the issue was with using it as a replacement for formal bayes solution but that can be discussed in p2) *n3) game theoretic aspects in the article (nobody really claims it cannot be a part of the article) So I suggest to leave n1n2n3 alone and focus on p1 p2 p3 p4 which for the most part can easily be fixed.","conv_id":"370760170.48343.48343","conv_title":"Talk:Monty Hall problem","conv_awry":false,"no.":1,"plutchik_emotion1":"distraction","plutchik_emotion2":"annoyance","plutchik_emotion3":"serenity","emowordnet_afraid_score":0.0868554587,"emowordnet_amused_score":0.1061393165,"emowordnet_angry_score":0.0891336607,"emowordnet_annoyed_score":0.0983784424,"emowordnet_dontcare_score":0.1031826351,"emowordnet_happy_score":0.1050958537,"emowordnet_inspired_score":0.1243353492,"emowordnet_sad_score":0.0812055251},{"index":466,"text":"Splendid! ::Clarification of motives: I am a professional mathematician and I do a lot of work on statistics in law medicine and so on; I talk to journalists...

The franchise originated in the WHL. The club that played in the WHL is the same franchise that entered the NHL. This is no different then the [wiki_link]. When Barry Van Gerbig was awarded an expansion team for the San Francisco market in 1965 (for the 1967\/68 season) he purchased the WHL club that year. He wanted to use that club as his expansion team. He decided it would be better to put the team in Oakland because the arena was brand new versus the venerable Cow Palace in San Francisco. This is why he moved the team from San Francisco to Oakland in 1966\/67 (and renamed them the California Seals). He wanted to prepare the club for their transfer into the NHL. When he brought the Seals into the NHL the following year as an expansion team he even kept a chunk of the roster intact. This included Charlie Burns George Swarbrick Gerry Odrowski Tom Thurlby and Ron Harris. Not only is this mentioned in the official NHL publication from 1991 called 'The Official National Hockey League 75th anniversary commemorative book' but its also noted in Brad Kurtzberg's great book 'Shorthanded: The Untold Story of the Seals: Hockey's Most Colorful Team'. Heck in the 1967\/68 NHL pre-season the Seals wore their WHL uniforms. I've seen pictures of them playing against the LA Kings with the WHL uniforms. They unveiled a new design prior to the start of the NHL regular season. So the fact is the franchise originated in 1961 in the WHL.
